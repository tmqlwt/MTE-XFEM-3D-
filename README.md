### Description
This paper presents the Minimum Total Energy Extended Finite Element Method (MTE-XFEM) to address the initiation and development problems of multiple cracks, which can be applied to the fracture analysis of linear elastic plane members under quasi-static and small deformation conditions. The proposed crack competition criterion is based on the minimum total energy principle. The initiation or propagation of cracks per unit length would lead to the maximum energy dissipation. Besides, a novel adaptive contact stiffness algorithm is proposed to tackle multi-crack contact surface simulation. The application of adaptive contact stiffness improves the convergence and applicability of contact simulations. The MTE-XFEM is realized by the MATLAB programming.
